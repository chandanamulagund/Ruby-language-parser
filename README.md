# Ruby language parser

This is designed using context free grammar in automata formal languages. In automata theory, a CFG (Context-Free Grammar) is a type of formal grammar used to describe the syntax or structure of a programming language or other formal language. A CFG consists of a set of production rules that define how symbols can be combined to form strings in the language.


### [Know more about context free grammar](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/context-free-grammar/)



This is a simple syntax parser in Ruby that can parse and evaluate code written in Python programming language. The parser can currently handle the following control structures:

* while loops
* do-while loops
* for loops

# Control Structures in Ruby 

-  while loop:
```
while condition do
  # Code to be executed while condition is true
end
```

-  do-while loop:
```
loop do
  # Code to be executed at least once
  break unless condition
end
```
-  for loop:

```
for item in iterable do
  # Code to be executed for each item in the iterable
end
```
