# Ruby-language-parser

This is a simple syntax parser in Ruby that can parse and evaluate code written in Python programming language. The parser can currently handle the following control structures:

1.while loops
2.do-while loops
3.for loops

# Control Structures in Ruby 

### - while loop:
```
while condition do
  # Code to be executed while condition is true
end
```

### * do-while loop:
```
loop do
  # Code to be executed at least once
  break unless condition
end
```
### + for loop:

```
for item in iterable do
  # Code to be executed for each item in the iterable
end
```
